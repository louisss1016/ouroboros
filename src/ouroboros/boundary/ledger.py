"""EventStore-backed ordering guard for the check-package boundary.

A boundary is one (Seed, verifier source) slot, for example one task and one
check variant. Its lifecycle is enforced at write time:

1. exactly one seal: ``record_package_frozen`` (the sealed package's opaque
   id and Seed digest persisted, ``package.seal_package``) or
   ``record_construction_failed``; a second package for the same boundary is
   refused, so admission feedback can never produce a regenerated package;
2. for a frozen package, exactly one ``record_admission`` whose receipt names
   the frozen package id, recorded before any actor starts;
3. ``record_actor_started`` refuses to start a worker until every boundary it
   binds is sealed (and, with a package, admitted), optionally refusing a
   workspace that contains generated check files;
4. ``record_candidate_verification`` must cite the frozen package id.

Regeneration policy. The seal rule above is per boundary id and never
changes. A caller that allows regeneration (the product run path) gives each
attempt its own boundary version id and calls ``record_superseded`` on the old
version once the new one is sealed; the old package stays in the journal,
marked superseded. A caller that forbids regeneration (an evaluation harness)
never calls it, so "exactly one package per boundary" holds unchanged.

``verify_boundary_order`` re-checks the same rules over replayed events for
audit and replay. The ledger assumes one writer per boundary.
