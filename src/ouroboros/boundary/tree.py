"""Byte-level manifests of checkout trees for protected-byte checks.

A manifest maps every workspace-relative file path to the SHA-256 of its bytes
(or to ``symlink:<target>`` for a symbolic link). A file or directory that
cannot be read, and anything that is neither a regular file, a directory nor a
symbolic link (a named pipe, a socket, a device), maps to ``UNREADABLE``: the
manifest is still computed, and a caller that must copy or judge the tree
sees which paths it cannot use (``unreadable_paths``). Paths whose components match
an unprotected name (by default version-control metadata and regenerable
interpreter or tool caches) are left out: running a test legitimately rewrites
them, and flagging them would make every run look like a mutation.
